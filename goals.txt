My Personal and Academic Goals for Next Year
1: Become confident in writing my own code and designing websites independently, with little or no external help.
2: Sharpen my coding skills to make my mentors at ALX proud of the time and effort theyâ€™ve invested in me.
3: Master at least five programming languages and improve my web design abilities to a professional level.
